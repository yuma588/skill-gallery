# Artifact Tool: Supported Spreadsheet Formulas
*Generated on 12/06/2025 at 6:58 +0000*

These are the set of formulas that are supported or unsupported in artifact_tool for recalculation.
Even if the function is unsupported, you may still set a cell's formula to that function, but it will not calculate
properly and instead produce an error like #NAME? or #ERROR? but upon export, it may still work.
